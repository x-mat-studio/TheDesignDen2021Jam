Hello there!

Thanks for playing our game! 

Neon Looper is a 'feeler' type of game in which you are trying to spin as fast as possible. Spinning faster will make you move faster (but also make you harder to control).

"Loop" your mouse around your character to increase it's RPM, kill enemies to get faster and try to hit the boss 3 times to win!

And most important of all: have fun while doing so! Revel in the spectale of light, sound and speed.

Happy looping!
